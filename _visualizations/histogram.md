lead: A histogram is a chart that displays numeric data in ranges, where each bar represents how frequently numbers fall into a particular range.
tags: [distribution]
guidance-always:
- Always include the frequency measurement on the y-axis and ranges on the x-axis.
- Always start the y-axis at zero.
- Always use a single color for all bars, except when using one additional color to highlight a single bar.
- Always use at least three intervals/ranges.
guidance-not-recommended:
- It is not recommended that you orient a histogram upside down.
guidance-never:
- Never add space between bars as the bars span an entire range of values.

Like a bar chart, histograms consist of a series of vertical bars along the x-axis. Histograms are most commonly used to depict what a set of data looks like in aggregate. At a quick glance, histograms tell whether a dataset has values that are clustered around a small number of ranges or are more spread out.
