lead: Including your agency’s logo can help users quickly determine the origin of your data visualization.
---
<p>
  When designing data visualizations for sharing, place your agency’s logo in a corner just outside of the data visualization, either in the top-right corner or below the source information. The size and placement of your agency’s logo should not disrupt the contents of a data visualization or its corresponding components.
</p>
<p>
  If your agency logo is presented elsewhere in a website that users will be viewing your data visualization in, including the logo next to your visualization is not necessary. For print-based data visualizations, your agency logo should always be included.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on logo placement, spacing, and styling, refer to your agency’s most recent brand guidelines.
