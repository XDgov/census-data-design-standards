lead: Including your agency’s logo can help users quickly determine the origin of your data visualization.

<p>
  When designing data visualizations for sharing, place your agency’s logo in one corner of your data visualization just outside of the visualization itself, either in the top-right corner or below the source information. The size and placement of your agency’s logo should not disrupt the contents of a data visualization or its corresponding components.

  If your agency logo is presented elsewhere in a website that users will be viewing your data visualization in, including the logo next to your visualization is not necessary. For print-based data visualizations, your agency logo should always be included.
