lead: Small multiples are a series of small visualizations that allow users to simply and quickly interpret changes across each visualization.

<p>
  Small multiples are best used when representing simple visualizations that include a small number of dimensions. Because small multiples are used to compare differences across visualizations, the visualization type used and the data compared should be consistent across the entire series of visualizations.

  Small multiples can be used with bar charts, histograms, line graphs, pie charts, and choropleth maps. Other visualization types are often too complex to be rendered at a small size, resulting in changes across visualizations becoming lost.
