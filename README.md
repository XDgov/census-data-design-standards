# U.S. Data Design Standards (Documentation Site)

This repo includes code and documentation for the U.S. Data Design Standards website.

Note that you'll see `!BASEURL!` used in place of `{{ site.baseurl }}` - this is [a workaround for not being able to use Liquid tags in frontmatter](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14650794/358804).
