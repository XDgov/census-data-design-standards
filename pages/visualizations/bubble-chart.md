<p>
  A bubble chart consists of a series of values that are plotted on an x-axis and y-axis, with each axis representing a variable and each value represented as a dot. The third variable value is then used to proportionally scale each bubble or dot. Bubble charts often include an explanatory variable, such as years of education, and what might be considered a response variable, such as annual income, and a proportional variable, such as population. When the dots are plotted against these two axes, bubble charts communicate the strength, type, and proportion of the relationship that exists between these variables.
