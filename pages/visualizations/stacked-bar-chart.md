title: Stacked Bar Chart
category: Visualization types
lead: A stacked bar chart is a bar chart that stacks subgroups of data to form each bar.
tags:
- Comparative
guidance-always:
- Stacked Bar graphs must have horizontal and vertical axes.
- The bar lengths must begin at 0.
- Include a legend along with labels.
- Maintain an even amount of space between bars.

guidance-recommended:
- The bars should be ordered by the values of the groups or one of the subgroups.
- Limit the number of subgroups to 5.
- If the subgroups have an order, use a sequential or diverging color scheme.
- If the subgroups do not have an order, use a qualitative color scheme.

guidance-not-recommended:
- Ordering bars by their alphabetical label. Instead, order by the value of the groups or a specific subgroup.
guidance-never:
- Depict more than 5 subgroups.

The length of each bar communicates the total value of the subgroups, and the length of each subgroup represents their individual values. Stacked bar charts are best used to compare data between bars and subgroups.
