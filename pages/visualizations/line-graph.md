Line graphs can be used to show how data changes over time and are often used to communicate trends, such as how household income changes each year. The x-axis can display continuous or discrete data such as days, years, or categories, and the y-axis is typically a continuous variable but can also be discrete. Line graphs can also be used to compare multiple trend lines, whereas bar charts can only represent one trend line.
