title: Proportional Symbol Map
category: Visualization types
lead: A proportional symbol map is a type of map that includes symbols that change in size based on the value they represent.
tags:
- Comparative
- Distribution
- Geospatial
guidance-always:
- Always include a legend.
- Always choose an appropriate symbol for your map
- Always choose a method for grouping your data carefully when using a graduated symbol map

guidance-recommended:
- It is recommend that you limit the number of class to five or fewer categories. Fewer symbols on the map are more easily distinguished by the eye and will make trends in the data easier to see.
- It is recommended that county boundaries be less prominent than state boundaries when creating a county-level choropleth map.

guidance-not-recommended:
- It is not recommended to have symbols on the map overlap. This can sometimes be appropriate depending on the type of symbol and scale of the map.

<p>
  Proportional symbol maps are typically used to show counts or totals and can be used to visualize classed or unclassed data. When using classed data, the map becomes a type of proportional symbol map called a graduated symbol map. The difference between these two types of maps is that graduated symbol maps use range grading, whereas proportional symbol maps use absolute scale or apparent magnitude scaling.
