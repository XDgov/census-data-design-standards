title: Box and Whisker
category: Visualization types
lead: A box and whisker plot, or boxplot, is a graph that presents data in a five-number summary.
tags:
- Comparative
- Distribution
guidance-always:
- Always label median, lower and upper quartiles, lowest and highest observations clearly.
- Always include a box centered on the median with left/bottom side ending at the lower quartile and right/top side at the upper quartile.
- Always include a horizontal line running through the center of the box beginning at the lowest observation and ending at the highest observation
guidance-recommended:
- It is recommended to use bar charts when comparing large changes in data values.
guidance-not-recommended:
- It is not recommended to remove outliers without making note of it.
guidance-never:
- Never use a box and whisker plot to represent dissimilar data.

<p>
  The five-number summary is broken down into minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Presenting data in this way is useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and whether there are potential outliers in the data. Box and whisker plots are also useful for comparing two or more datasets and for representing a large number of observations.

  Box and whisker plots can be displayed horizontally or vertically and displayed side-by-side for comparisons.
