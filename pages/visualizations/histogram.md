title: Histogram
category: Visualization types
lead: A histogram is a chart that displays numeric data in ranges, where each column represents how frequently numbers fall into each range.
tags:
- Distribution
guidance-always:
- Include the frequency measurement in the y-axis and ranges in the x-axis.
- Start the Y-axis at zero.
- Use a single color for all bars, except when using one additional color to highlight a single column.

guidance-recommended:
- Contain at lease 3 intervals/ranges.

guidance-not-recommended:
- Orient the chart to face downwards.
guidance-never:
- Add too much space between bars, as the bars span an entire range of values.

Like a bar chart, histograms consist of a series of vertical bars along the x-axis. Histograms are most commonly used to depict what a set of data looks like in aggregate. At a quick glance, histograms communicate whether a dataset has values that are evenly distributed or if the values are more concentrated. To compare the distribution of values of a given dataset, consider using a box plot instead.
