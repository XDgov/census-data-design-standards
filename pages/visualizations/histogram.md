title: Histogram
category: Visualization types
lead: A histogram is a chart that displays numeric data in ranges, where each column represents how frequently numbers fall into a particular range.
tags:
- Distribution
guidance-always:
- Include the frequency measurement in the y-axis and ranges in the x-axis.
- Start the y-axis at 0.
- Use a single color for all bars, except when using one additional color to highlight a single column.
- Contain at lease 3 intervals/ranges.
guidance-not-recommended:
- Orienting the chart upside down, where the 0 value of the y-axis is at the top of the chart.
guidance-never:
- Add space between bars, as the bars span an entire range of values.

Like a bar chart, histograms consist of a series of vertical bars along the x-axis. Histograms are most commonly used to depict what a set of data looks like in aggregate. At a quick glance, histograms tell whether a dataset has values that are clustered around a small number of ranges or are more spread out.
