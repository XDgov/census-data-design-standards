A population pyramid consists of a series of histogram bars on opposing sides, where each side represents male or female and each row represents an age group. When the population is growing, a population pyramid will form the shape of a pyramid. As an alternative to the population pyramid, a horizontal stacked bar chart can be used when gender isnâ€˜t being represented.
