To do this, a series of values are plotted on an x-axis and a y-axis, with each axis representing a variable and each value represented as a dot. Scatter plots often include an explanatory variable, such as years of education, and what might be considered a response variable, such as annual income. When the dots are plotted against these two axes, scatter plots communicate the strength and type of relationship that exists between these variables.
