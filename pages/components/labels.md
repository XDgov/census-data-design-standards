<p> 
  Labels are traditionally used to label axes and legends, however, they can
  also be used inside of data visualizations to communicate categories, values,
  or annotations. Where possible, labels should be used in favor of legends or
  tooltips to make it easier for users to understand data visualizations.
</p>
<div id="data-labels">
  <h2>Data Labels</h2>
  <p>
    Data labels are applied directly to elements inside of a visualization to
    show the value of a datapoint or the category of the data. When using data
    labels for values, you can omit the corresponding axis to reduce redundancies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using data labels for categories, such as in a line graph, you can omit
    using a legend as this is the prefered method for representing categorical
    data.
  </p> 
</div>
<div id="annotations">
  <h2>Annotations</h2>
  <p>
    Annotations can be used to help tell the story of a data visualization. Before
    choosing to use annotations, make sure they do not reduce a userâ€™s ability
    to understand the data inside of your data visualization.
