<p>
  When cited properly, sources help expert users access the underlying data for
  their own purposes. While many federal agencies have their own guidance for
  formatting sources (see below), a good place to start is for your source
  statement to include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicates the program(s) that provided the data.</li>
  <li>Indicates the date of the source data.</li>
  <li>If publicly accessible online, is linked to the source data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Placement</h2>
<p>
  Sources should be the last element included in a data visualization, ideally
  below the description or the visualization itself.
</p>
