<p>
  In addition to a traditional title element, data visualizations can also
  contain subtitles and axis titles to further clarify the purpose of a data
  visualization to users.
</p>
<div id="titles">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>
    Titles should be present on all data visualizations and contain no more than
    two lines of text. A title should broadly describe what is contained in a
    data visualization without identifying any trends or highlights in the data.
  </p>
  <h3>Title Examples</h3>
  <div class="usa-chart-card typography-card">
    <h3 class="usa-chart-title">First Chart Title</h3>
    <h3 class="usa-chart-title">Second Chart Title</h3>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="subtitles">
  <h2>Subtitle</h2>
  <p>
    Subtitles can be used to describe any trends or highlights in a data
    visualization. Subtitles can also be used to indicate the unit of 
    measurement if preferable to an Axis Title. While subtitles are optional,
    their presence helps to clarify the purpose of a visualization to users.
  </p>
  <h3>Subtitle Examples</h3>
  <div class="usa-chart-card typography-card">
    <h4 class="usa-chart-subtitle">First Chart Subitle</h4>
    <h4 class="usa-chart-subtitle">Second Chart Subtitle</h4>
  </div>
