  <h2>Grid Lines</h2>
  <p>
    Grid lines are the foundation of any grid inside a data visualization. Grid lines should be rendered in a color, such as gray, that doesn’t clutter the data visualization, but should have just enough contrast to be visible. Grid lines should never overlap data points and instead be rendered as a background element.
  </p>

  <h2>Grids in Maps</h2>
  <p>
    Grids can be displayed in two ways on a map: either as a traditional grid or as a graticule. Traditional grids correspond to grid systems outside of latitude and longitude, such as the military grid system. Unless you are an expert cartography, we highly recommend avoiding these types of grids.

  <p>
    Alternatively, <strong>graticules</strong> are lines showing the latitude and longitude of the earth on a map. Graticules can help contextualize a map for users but aren’t always necessary. When using graticules, be sure to follow the grid lines guidance above to ensure the lines don’t distract from the contents of the map.
