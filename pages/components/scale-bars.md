<p>
  While scale can be indicated via a ratio or in words (i.e. 1:10, or “One inch to ten miles”), scale bars are a common graphical alternative for indicating scale. The primary benefit of using a scale bar to indicate scale are that scale bars can be more easily used to allow users to measure distances in maps.
